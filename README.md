# Specflow-Test-Parameters

Project is .NET CORE 2.2 using Specflow+Runner 3.077

Background : I can read the Url from Specflow.json. But everytime I have to update this for different environments.

So, I wanted to used .runsettings so I can use that at run time.

But when Using this file not able to read TestParameters.

Specflow team have informed that Specflow doesn't support TestRunParameters.

I am looking for a workaround to make it work.
